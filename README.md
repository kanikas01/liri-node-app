# LIRI

LIRI is a node-based command line app used to search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.  Here is a brief [video walkthrough](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KspaEDqK7ddoDYIkwo48C4BxMVHr_MAa) describing how to use the app. Basic usage is as follows:

*Use the "Bands in Town" API to search for concerts*  
node liri.js concert-this &lt;artist/band name&gt;   

*Use the "Spotify" API to search for songs*  
node liri.js spotify-this-song &lt;song name&gt;  

*Use the "OMDB" API to search for movies*
